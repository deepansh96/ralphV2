# Create Slices

Create or refresh implementation sub-issues for GitHub issue `{{ISSUE}}` in repo `{{REPO}}`.

Issue: {{ISSUE}}
Repo: {{REPO}}
Workspace: {{WORKSPACE}}
Step: {{STEP_ID}}
Skills: {{SKILLS_DIR}}

## Goal

Read the PRD from the parent GitHub issue, draft vertical implementation slices, run two independent council reviews, and create AFK-ready sub-issues linked under the parent issue.

## Required Inputs

- Read the GitHub issue body, which should now contain the PRD:
  `gh issue view {{ISSUE}} --repo {{REPO}}`
- Read project `CONTEXT.md`.
- Read project `CLAUDE.md`.
- Read any ADRs under `docs/adr/` if that directory exists.
- Read `{{SKILLS_DIR}}/to-issues/SKILL.md` if it exists. If not, still follow the slice rules below.
- Check existing sub-issues before creating anything so re-runs do not create duplicates.

## Slice Rules

Draft vertical slices following the `to-issues` skill rules:

- Use tracer bullets: each slice should deliver one end-to-end behavior that can be implemented and verified independently.
- Do not create horizontal slices by technical layer, file type, component category, or infrastructure-only work.
- Each slice must include a clear user-facing or operator-visible behavior, acceptance criteria, and focused test guidance.
- Keep slices small enough for one AFK implementation step, but complete enough that the resulting code is useful.
- Mark every generated sub-issue as AFK.
- Keep future work or blocked-by references out of the generated sub-issues unless the PRD explicitly requires them for this issue.

## Council Review

Run exactly two rounds of independent council review using the standalone wrapper.

Round 1:

```bash
./ralph-v2/scripts/council-review.sh --only {{REVIEWER}} "IMPORTANT: You are a reviewer. DO NOT modify any files, create branches, run tests, or make any changes to the codebase or config. Only read and analyze. Provide feedback as text output only.

Review the draft vertical slices for GitHub issue {{ISSUE}} in repo {{REPO}}. Focus on horizontal slicing, missing acceptance criteria, dependency problems, test gaps, and conflicts with CONTEXT.md, CLAUDE.md, or ADRs."
```

Incorporate the Round 1 feedback into the slice list. Keep major feedback that changes slice boundaries, sequencing, correctness, or testing. Drop nitpicks and style-only comments.

Round 2:

```bash
./ralph-v2/scripts/council-review.sh --only {{REVIEWER}} "IMPORTANT: You are a reviewer. DO NOT modify any files, create branches, run tests, or make any changes to the codebase or config. Only read and analyze. Provide feedback as text output only.

Review the revised vertical slices for GitHub issue {{ISSUE}} in repo {{REPO}}. Focus on remaining blockers, duplicate or overlapping slices, missing AFK criteria, unresolved dependencies, and contradictions introduced while incorporating Round 1 feedback."
```

Incorporate the Round 2 feedback into the final slice list using the same filtering rules. Do not run additional review rounds.

## GitHub Sub-Issue Creation

Create one GitHub issue per final slice using:

```bash
gh issue create --repo {{REPO}} --title "<slice title>" --body-file <slice-body-file>
```

Each sub-issue body must include:

- `AFK: true`
- Parent issue reference: `Parent: #{{ISSUE}}`
- Slice summary
- Acceptance criteria
- Testing guidance
- Out-of-scope notes where needed

After each issue is created, link it to the parent with GitHub GraphQL `addSubIssue`.

Required GraphQL flow:

1. Resolve the parent issue node ID with `gh api graphql`.
2. Resolve or capture each created sub-issue node ID.
3. Call the `addSubIssue` mutation for each missing parent/sub-issue relationship.

The mutation must use the parent issue ID and sub-issue ID; do not rely only on markdown references.

## Idempotency

This step is idempotent:

- Before creating sub-issues, inspect existing sub-issues linked to parent `#{{ISSUE}}`.
- Also check repo issues for existing slice issues that reference `Parent: #{{ISSUE}}`.
- Re-running must not create duplicate sub-issues.
- If an intended slice already exists, update or reuse it rather than creating another issue.
- If a sub-issue exists but is not linked under the parent, only run the `addSubIssue` mutation.

## Output File

Write the final slice plan to:

```text
{{WORKSPACE}}/slices.md
```

Include the created or reused sub-issue numbers and whether each was newly created, reused, or newly linked.

Complete normally only after all final AFK sub-issues exist and are linked under the parent issue.
