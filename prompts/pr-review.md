# PR Review

Create or update the pull request for GitHub issue `{{ISSUE}}` in repo `{{REPO}}`, then run automated code review.

Issue: {{ISSUE}}
Repo: {{REPO}}
Workspace: {{WORKSPACE}}
Branch: {{BRANCH}}
Base branch: {{BASE_BRANCH}}
Step: {{STEP_ID}}
Skills: {{SKILLS_DIR}}

Default agent: claude
Mode: AFK, no HITL

## Failure Protocol

If any operation fails irrecoverably (checkout, push, PR creation, code review invocation), set this step's status to `failed` in `{{WORKSPACE}}/state.json` with a note explaining the failure, then stop.

## Goal

Create an idempotent PR from the feature branch to the base branch, write a comprehensive PR description with a summary of changes, linked sub-issues, and a human QA checklist, then invoke the `code-review:code-review` plugin skill so automated review is posted as PR comments.

## Required Inputs

- Read project `CONTEXT.md`.
- Read project `CLAUDE.md`.
- Read any ADRs under `docs/adr/` if that directory exists.
- Read the parent issue:
  `gh issue view {{ISSUE}} --repo {{REPO}}`
- Read the current workspace state:
  `{{WORKSPACE}}/state.json`
- Read the final review summary if it exists:
  `{{WORKSPACE}}/final-review.md`
- Identify implementation sub-issues from state steps where `type` is `implement-slice`, then read each sub-issue:
  `gh issue view <sub-issue-number> --repo {{REPO}}`

## Branch

Work on the feature branch recorded in state:

```bash
git checkout {{BRANCH}}
```

If checkout fails, stop and report the failure.

Ensure the branch is pushed before creating or updating the PR:

```bash
git push
```

If upstream tracking is missing, push with:

```bash
git push -u origin {{BRANCH}}
```

## PR Body

Write a PR body file in the workspace, for example:

```text
{{WORKSPACE}}/pr-body.md
```

The PR description must include:

- Summary of changes.
- Linked sub-issues.
- Human QA checklist.
- Final review outcome from `{{WORKSPACE}}/final-review.md`, if available.

Use this structure:

```md
## Summary

- ...

## Linked Issues

- Closes #<sub-issue>
- Parent: #{{ISSUE}}

## Final Review

- ...

## Human QA Checklist

- [ ] ...
```

## Idempotent PR Creation

Do not create duplicate PRs.

First check whether a PR already exists for the branch:

```bash
gh pr list --repo {{REPO}} --head {{BRANCH}} --base {{BASE_BRANCH}} --state open --json number,url
```

If an open PR exists, update its title and body instead of creating another PR:

```bash
gh pr edit <pr-number> --repo {{REPO}} --title "<title>" --body-file {{WORKSPACE}}/pr-body.md
```

If no open PR exists, create one:

```bash
gh pr create --repo {{REPO}} --base {{BASE_BRANCH}} --head {{BRANCH}} --title "<title>" --body-file {{WORKSPACE}}/pr-body.md
```

Capture the PR number and URL from either the existing PR or the newly created PR.

## Automated Code Review

Invoke the `code-review:code-review` plugin skill on the PR after the PR exists.

The review must be posted as PR comments. If the skill requires a PR URL, pass the PR URL. If it requires repository, base, and head information, pass `{{REPO}}`, `{{BASE_BRANCH}}`, and `{{BRANCH}}`.

If the `code-review:code-review` plugin skill is unavailable or fails, stop and report the failure. Do not mark this step complete unless the automated review has been invoked successfully.

## Output

After the PR is created or updated and the automated review is invoked, write a concise record to:

```text
{{WORKSPACE}}/pr-review.md
```

Include:

- PR number and URL.
- Whether the PR was created or updated.
- Linked sub-issues included in the body.
- Confirmation that `code-review:code-review` was invoked and review comments were posted.

## Completion

Complete normally only after:

- The feature branch has been pushed.
- An open PR exists from `{{BRANCH}}` to `{{BASE_BRANCH}}`.
- Re-running the step would update the existing PR instead of creating a duplicate.
- The PR description includes a summary of changes, linked sub-issues, and a human QA checklist.
- The `code-review:code-review` plugin skill has been invoked on the PR.
- Automated review is posted as PR comments.
